# Gear 
The gear designed in Onshape is a precision-engineered mechanical component featuring a series of evenly spaced teeth around its circumference. This design allows for effective transfer of rotational motion and torque between different parts of a mechanical assembly. The gear is typically made from durable materials like aluminum or high-strength plastic, ensuring longevity and reliability in various applications.

Applications:
Gears play a crucial role in numerous mechanical systems, including:
* Automotive Systems: Used in transmissions to control speed and torque.
* Robotics: Essential for motion control in robotic arms and wheeled robots.
* Consumer Electronics: Used in devices such as cameras and printers for precise movements.
  
Tools Used to Design Gear:
* Sketch Tool: Used to create the initial 2D profile of the gear, including circles to define the pitch diameter and construction lines for positioning.
* Line Tool: Employed to draw the gear tooth profile within the sketch.
* Trim Tool: Utilized to remove unnecessary segments of the sketch, refining the gear tooth shape.
* Circular Pattern Tool: Applied within the sketch to replicate the gear tooth profile around the center, ensuring evenly spaced teeth.
* Extrude Tool: Used to convert the completed 2D sketch into a 3D model by extruding the gear profile to the desired thickness.
* Fillet Tool: Applied to round off sharp edges on the gear teeth, enhancing durability and performance.
